  heading: Who Am I?
  text: I am Nusrat, a non-fiction and fiction writer based in Bangladesh. For as
    long as I had been able, I read and dreamed about one day becoming someone
    who writes about things that matter...and also things that don't make much
    change.

    text: E S S A Y S are something we cannot live without. I write research essays
      about concurrent news, society, feminism, and books. I like to write
      personal essays about all the things I've experienced and the things I've
      learned about traveling, reading, and existing in this world as a woman.

    text: F I C T I O N has the ability to show us many things without really being
      intrusive. I love reading fiction and I love writing it. It fills my mind
      with endless possibility and hopes that out there, someone is living my
      fiction, good or bad, anything in fiction is written in the light of
      reality.

      P O E T R Y

      is something that not everyone loves, but something that everyone can appreciate.

      I love writing down my thoughts in a verse, or without one, even. Poems have the capacity to say a lot without wasting too many words. I write poems about social inequality, freedom, and change.

  heading: About Me
  text: I am a writer, reader, editor, teacher and most of all... a dreamer. I
    have always had vivid imaginations and now I'm trying to put them into
    papers. I have been a regular writer on Medium for some time now and
    enjoying my writing experiences.
