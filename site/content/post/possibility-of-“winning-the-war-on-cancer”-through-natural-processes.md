Cancer is the most common terminal disease worldwide and its reach is extending each year. [Most recent papers from WHO](https://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/04/health/who-world-cancer-report/index.html) show that number of cancer patients will rise from 14 million annually in 2012 to 22 million within two decades. Over the same period, cancer deaths are predicted to [rise from 8.2 million a year to 13 million.](https://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/04/health/who-world-cancer-report/index.html) ***The treatment and medicine are too expensive for lower-income individuals and people of third world countries.** A natural cure would be a relief for so many of these patients suffering from cancer.* In *[Winning the War on Cancer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38312881-winning-the-war-on-cancer)*, Sylvie Beljanski talks about finding natural cures for cancer from plant extracts.

**I have lost three relatives close to my heart to various types of cancer.** No one I know has survived this disease, so the idea that the disease that cost them their lives could be cured so easily feels surreal to me. When I first picked this book up to read, I wasn’t sure about what to expect. I am someone who doesn’t believe in alternative medicine, I prefer to trust in good *packaging* of the products from big pharmaceutical companies, with famous researches that follow. *Even though ayurvedic treatment or homeopathic medicine is quite common in my community, I always give them a badge of disapproval.*

But after reading the book, I couldn’t help doing some digging to find how logical the information is.

# The Beljanski Foundation

Sylvie Beljanski is the Vice-president of the [Beljanski Foundation](https://www.beljanski.org/engl/), which was established in 1999 to help spread the awareness of treating cancer through natural means. Sylvie is the daughter of a French researcher from the Pasteur Institute, Dr. Mirko Beljanski. Ever since she was little, she saw her father help cancer patients get better by prescribing natural medicine.

*He had discovered that **DNA destabilization is the primary cause of cancer.*** Then, he spent most of his life trying to find a natural remedy to take the place of expensive cancer treatment. He was successful in finding plant extracts that can completely eradicate cancer stem cells in a matter of hours, without being toxic to the healthy cells! Even though I find it surreal, I have no basis for calling bullshit as Sylvie provides enough logical explanations and citations in the book.

# The Findings of Dr. Beljanski

* ### **DNA destabilization is the main cause of cancer**

Nobel Prize winner Jacques Monod found that the main reason for cancer was a mutation in DNA. But, Beljanski found different information. He went on to demonstrate that the primary difference between normal and cancer DNA actually lies in the increased opening between the two strands of the double helix. In his view, mutations certainly can and do, contribute to cancer, but they are secondary. *Indeed, mutations are more likely to occur once the DNA has been destabilized, making the destabilization the primary factor.*

* ### **Eradicating cancer stem cells that are not affected by radiation or chemotherapy**

Traditional treatments for cancer include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. But even though these treatments can shrink or eliminate tumors, often, cancer can return with a vengeance. [This is due to the cancer stem cells](https://med.stanford.edu/ludwigcenter/overview/theory.html).\
According to research, cancer cells are not all created equal. A malignant tumor or the circulating cancerous cells of leukemia, for instance, can harbor many different cell types. The stem cell theory of cancer proposes that among all cancerous cells, only a few act as stem cells.

His research showed that the plant extracts **have the capability to completely eradicate the cancer stem cells** very fast, without causing any harm to the healthy cells.

* ### **Plant extracts in healing pancreatic and ovarian cancer**

***Pao pereira** extract and the **Rauwolfia vomitoria** extract, worked beautifully against **pancreatic cancer stem cells**, as well as **ovarian cancer stem cells**. Pancreatic and ovarian cancers are very difficult to treat because they are usually diagnosed very late, and the tumor cells generally become resistant to the drugs chosen for treatment.*

* ### **Natural extracts that can work side by side with conventional medicine**

Beljanski’s researches found that a person taking chemotherapy can also take the natural medicine side by side. As they are extracted from plants, they don’t have any side effects whatsoever.

# Political and Economic Prejudice

In this book, Sylvie conveys her passion for her father's work and how she plans to advance the research even after her father's death. As a lawyer with no background in medicine, she had a difficult journey ahead of her. **I loved that the book is honest and emotional, as well as providing full proof information with credible citations.**

I liked that the writer is not timid in telling the truth. She writes about her father's hardships in carrying out research that would treat cancer by inexpensive remedies. ***Big pharmaceutical companies were opposed to this research because it would cut off their profits.***

In 1990, French President [François Mitterrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Mitterrand) was officially diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer. After miraculously treating him, Beljanski came to the notice of some *not so helpful* people. *He became a victim of political prejudice and also had to deal with unfair political wrath over his research, as far as **getting banned from practicing medicine** a few years before his tragic death.*

# How Much to Believe

*It seems unbelievable to me that something like this exists but not many of us know much about it.* It does seem too good to be true.

But reading this book felt very personal and mind-boggling.* **I realized that I felt sadness and anger after reading all about this natural remedy.*** Sad, because my uncle died of prostate cancer. No meds or therapy was enough to keep him with us. His family still has to burden the heavy hit on their finances. But Beljanski had cured this same type of cancer in the twentieth century by using plant extracts — where we used to think it was incurable just 10 years ago.

I feel anger because — if all they say are true, then *maybe* he wouldn’t have died.

But we choose to stay ignorant and don’t want to give a chance to something that seems too good — because we like to stay in the dark.

As someone who had no prior knowledge about cancer, its causes, or treatment, I am not someone to state what is right or what is wrong. But this book made me want to believe in a natural cure for cancer.
