I had never gone to the sea even if Cox’s Bazar, the longest sea beach in the world was approximately 400 kilometers away from my home. During my childhood, it was a place of great fascination that I wanted to visit. I always tried to imagine what I’d feel like when I first smelled the salty air; when I first dipped my feet in the water. I wondered if I could walk along the full 150-kilometer length of the beach.

But gradually, it became something surreal that I only dreamed about.

In my second year in the university, we had a batch tour scheduled where all of my batch mates would be traveling to Cox’s Bazar for a measly two days and two nights visit. I finally had the chance to go, I convinced my parents to let me go with them. Not an easy feat, even though I was an adult of 20 years. As Bangladeshi conventional parents, they were *inclined to decline* my plan of going 400 km away with a bunch of *irresponsible University kids*. *I convinced them that my best friend and I were the epitome of responsibility and would stick together, no matter what.* And promised that I wouldn’t be going into the water. *Of course, I didn’t mean that but they didn’t have to know.*

## The 11-hour bus journey

*There were three buses filled with 143 students with two organizing professors to look after the proceedings. We were supposed to travel through the night on the bus, arrive by 6 am, get a bit of rest, and go to the sea (or bay, as per the name: Bay of Bengal). I wasn’t going there to rest, so my target was to spend as much of the time as I could on the beach.* But so much for wishful thinking.

The bus started well after midnight and we were frustrated with the organizers. But it was organized by a council comprised of a number of those *irresponsible students* my parents were talking about and so we knew this was a possibility.

When the journey was well underway, I loosened a breath I didn't know I was holding. *I was really doing something about this life-long dream of mine!* I was going to Cox’s Bazar. But there was a slight fear too. *I always get disappointed when I finally get something after a long period of wanting it.* A popular book, an acclaimed movie, a long-awaited video game. *I think and fantasize about it so much that the real thing never rises up to my expectations. I was scared that I would be disappointed by the sea too.*

Anyways, I tried to leave all the worrying aside. I love journeying through the night. Everything seems magical. I saw the city fly by as I drifted off to sleep with the cool night air on my face.

I woke up and saw the edges of a water body on the horizon. My excitement died out as I realized this couldn’t be the sea as we still had ways to go. Everyone woke up and the buses stopped so that we could get breakfast. When we boarded the bus again, it was more lively. Everyone started singing and dancing to the music playing on the speaker. Me being ever the observer and never the performer, I took my joy from the scenery and songs.

## The Bay of Bengal

*We arrived later than we expected. I wanted to go straight to the beach, but my best friend is as much a girly girl as I was not. She wanted to freshen up, get changed out of the travel clothes. Yes, she probably was the normal one out of the two of us.* We decided to skip lunch and went straight to the beach.

It was off-season, so the crowd was not as dense as it could be. I stared at the water from afar and took a long breath. I had always wondered if the sea air was different than river air. There was definitely salt in the air (as my hair is the witness). We went straight to the edge of the water, the waves seemed strong, much to my excitement. But I cannot swim, so you can imagine the slight fear of getting in the water. So, a few dips underwater seemed as exhilarating as surfing or swimming with sharks is for some people.

“Well? Is this all you’ve imagined?” my friend asked, knowing how nervous I was about disappointment.

“Yes,” I replied.

It was. *I will never forget the scene of the sun bleeding over the water and gradually setting where the water meets the sky. I will never forget the sky — dotted with so many tiny diamonds that I never get to see in the city sky.*

## The mishap

*They say a story is useless if there’s no drama.* To me, that trip was a dream come true until the end of the last day. Just two days on the beach is never enough. So we wanted to prolong our visit. We decided, or those *irresponsible council students* decided to stay one more day. Suddenly they became a popular group being praised by all of us.

But, being as irresponsible as they were, they didn’t bother trying to extend our stay at the hotel. We were supposed to check out in the evening and board the bus back by midnight. But we got evicted from the hotel because another group of students was coming there that night and we couldn’t stay. No other place could house all of us in such short notice. This felt like a nightmare. We were standing in front of the hotel with all our backpacks and luggage, arguing and whining about the lousy organization.

## Finding friends

We decided that we would indeed be leaving by 12 when one of us said he would not be doing that.

“Why are we wasting this time standing here and arguing? Let’s spend the night on the beach tonight!”

We realized we had the chance to go where the night takes us. We set off to the beach and divided into our cliques.

Some unfortunate souls decided to get their own rooms in different hotels. They were helpful enough to keep our bags with them, so good for us.

I walked by the edge of the water, talking about our deep thoughts we’d never voice during the day. We shared our deepest fears, darkest secrets. We became one with nature and we learned so much about each other on *one night* that we didn’t get to after studying together for *two years*. I realized that we made friends for life. I would never forget these people; these people who had been mere acquaintances but never friends.

By 2 in the morning, we gravitated by a huge bonfire and sat in a circle. Someone had arranged a couple of guitars and a singing and dancing party started. We sang about love and heartbreak, adventures and friendship. Everyone forgot the issues of the evening and enjoyed our time. I saw that normal tourists also joined our circle and sang songs. But gradually they dispersed. I fell asleep at one point and when I woke up just an hour later, the sky was lightening and the music was still in the air. Some of us have gone earlier to climb the hills to see the sunrise. As I sat there with my newer, *closer* friends as the sun rose from behind the hills opposite the sea, and realized this trip could not have been any more perfect.

## There and back again

We started our journey back the next evening as the sun was setting. My parents were blowing my phone up with calls and texts, even though I told them the situation. Our return journey was too long. But everyone was peaceful. On the way home, the bus was quiet, everyone lost in their own thoughts. I watched the sea as long as I could, peeking in between buildings and trees in the approaching darkness. I said a silent goodbye as it got too dark to see.

*I didn’t sleep on the bus that night. I was too busy trying to archive all that I had seen and felt while standing by the vastness of the sea and under the huge expanse of sky.* I will be going back there one day. I will probably see many more oceans with many more beaches, but this one trip will forever be engraved in my mind.
