<!--StartFragment-->

I have noticed a strange thing about myself: while reading a long book series, I don’t particularly love the main characters. The story spends so much time with them that they feel slightly boring.

So I find myself waiting for someone else to show up in the story, which is most of the time the bad guy. *If written well, the baddies have the power to make us feel more than the good guys.* The villains make us support the main characters, we want to cheer them on just because we don’t want the bad guys to succeed. For example, being inside Harry Potter’s head felt somewhat tiring at times, and I impatiently waited when Draco would come and throw an insult. *You won’t see me admit it in broad daylight, but I liked reading about Malfoy’s character arc more than Harry’s.*

*Similarly, so many times I feel amazed by the villain’s backstory, disgusted by their characters, grudging respect for their cunning.* So, here is a list of perfect villainous characters in literature you would hate with a passion, or secretly love despite yourself.

# 1. Humbert Humbert, **[Lolita](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7604.Lolita?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=KFBPkN0Fbc&rank=1)**

**Vladimir Nabokov**

*Mystery/Tragedy*

There isn’t one person who read *Lolita* but wasn’t completely creeped out by Humbert. In this masterpiece, we get to see the world through the lens of a psychopathic pedophile who wants to harm an innocent 12-year-old girl. We get to learn the villain’s point of view for the first time.

> *Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita. (Humbert in **[Lolita](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7604.Lolita?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=KFBPkN0Fbc&rank=1)**)*

He is a character I hate with so much passion…but I also admire the creation of this character. *If this character hadn’t been written so well that he gives us goosebumps, then we wouldn’t love the book as much as we do.* But this is also a character that will make you try to justify his actions and it will make you find things that you can relate to. *This disturbing character has the ability to bring all your insecurities to the surface.*

# 2. Maeve, **[Throne of Glass](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7896527-throne-of-glass?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=0yEvjdPuDR&rank=1)** Series

**Sarah J Maas**\
*Fantasy/Thriller*

*In the fantasy land of Elirea, Maeve is a powerful queen almost as revered as a goddess. She has power beyond measure and a heart of pure darkness.*

*She is a master at manipulation but she also has this capacity of demanding loyalty and getting it*. She is charismatic and cunning. Every time her part came up, I found myself sneering at her. She is egotistic, heinous, and charming all at once: such a weird collection of characteristics.

I can’t even describe how much I hate her — what is a better achievement than that for a villain?

# 3. Professor James Moriarty, [Sherlock Holmes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13412597-the-final-problem-and-other-stories?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=1thmwm3B1P&rank=3)

**Arthur Conan Doyle**\
*Detective thriller*

Moriarty is the people’s favorite crazy talent. Even though I am biased while thinking about this character as in my mind, *Moriarty is Andrew Scott from BBC’s Sherlock*. But reading about him is also fun.

> *‘Moriarty is the Napoleon of crime, Watson.* He is the organizer of half that is evil and nearly all that is undetected in this great city. He is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker. He has a brain of the first order.’ (*Sherlock in* **The Final Problem**)

*He is wickedly brilliant and the perfect enemy for Sherlock Holmes. He is a criminal mastermind who can give Sherlock a run for his life.* He was literally thought up to kill Sherlock and end the series. Even though there isn’t much about him by Doyle himself, we get to love and hate him through various fanfictions and spin-offs.

# 4. King Leck, **[Graceling](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3236307-graceling?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=NZUpd9mk6I&rank=1)** Trilogy

**Kristin Cashore**\
*Fantasy/Thriller*

He is the people’s favorite king about whom no one ever says one wrong word. But is he that much benevolent? Or is there something else?

*He is so unerringly villainous that you have to admire his cruelty. An ordinary orphan manipulated a royal family to a point that they declared him their heir and made him king…not everyone can do it. I hated him with a vengeance the moment I read about him. He is cruel even in his innocence, even when he is shown as just a kid. This is a character that is bound to give you goosebumps.*

# 5. Alec d’Urberville, **[Tess of the D’Urbervilles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32261.Tess_of_the_D_Urbervilles?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=bxxnagRVMn&rank=1)**

**Thomas Hardy**\
*Classic/Romance*

If there’s one villain in classic literature that I absolutely abhor, that’s Alec d’Urberville. He is vile and cruel. A strong hero demands a strong villain and that villain should have his own sets of morals to make him admirable. But Alec is not of that league.

*Tess was sweet and innocent. She was clueless about his intentions and still, he took advantage of her and then left her to stand in front of the cruel society. If there’s one villain whose death made me happy, that’s him.*

# 6. Dolores Umbridge, **[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2.Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=0EqdFzRsYP&rank=1)**

**J.K. Rowling**\
*Fantasy*

Admit it. You believe that the most villainous character in Harry Potter is not You-Know-Who, but Umbridge. *She is so perfectly evil because she thinks her work is helping create a change. She wants to help discipline the magical world and rise up in the world.*

> “You know, I really hate children.” (*Umbridge in* **The Order of Phoenix**)

But each time her part comes up, I can’t help calling her names. And the times when she is absolutely comical? Best scenes. We love reading about her because she gets punished in the most hilarious of ways. *And who hasn’t fist-pumped when she got her pride handed to her by the Weasely twins as the perfect type of revenge?*

# 7. Hannibal Lecter, **[The Silence of the Lambs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23807.The_Silence_of_the_Lambs?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=CENA79KSGw&rank=1)**

**Thomas Harris**\
*Psychological Horror*

The brilliant people turned twisted become the worst type of monster. *Hannibal Lecter is a brilliant forensic psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer who is serving nine consecutive life sentences in a mental institute for serial murders.*

*He is the epitome of the modern-day villains, but he will make you feel revolted and exhilarated*. *He is witty and charming; terrifying and disgusting. He is the worst type of psychopath.* But he still becomes a kind of ‘hero’ figure in the story as he helps the FBI in capturing another serial killer. He is such a horrifying character but he succeeded in earning my respect.

> *“The worm that destroys you is the temptation to agree with your critics, to get their approval.” (**Hannibal**)*

# 8. The Darkling, **[The Grisha Trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27280362-the-grisha-trilogy?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=3k8T0G2j5C&rank=1)**

**Leigh Bardugo**\
*Fantasy*

In the world of YA and fantasy, The Darkling is the favorite bully. He is the perfect combination of badass, cruel, and charismatic — making us want to believe in his cause. He is strong enough to lead the Grisha army, and also cunning enough to trick the reader into believing that he is the good guy.

> “I’ve seen what you truly are,” said the Darkling, “and I’ve never turned away. I never will. Can he say the same?” (*The Darkling in*** [Siege and Storm](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/19699752))**

As I was reading this series, I wanted to comfort him. I wanted to root for him and frighteningly, I tried to find reason in every bad thing he did. He is logical enough that he can persuade you to like him. He will test your morals and question your judgment. Does a villainous character get better than this?

# 9. President Snow, [The Hunger Games](https://www.goodreads.com/series/73758-the-hunger-games)

**Suzanne Collins**\
*Dystopian Fantasy/Science fiction*

To all the Hunger Games fans out there — I think you know what I want to say about Snow. He is ruthless, wicked, and all that the ‘snake’ emoji embodies. But, he is also honest and straight forward. We all hated him when he sent kids off to a game where they kill each other to death as political manipulation.

> *Hope is the only thing stronger than fear. A little hope is effective. A lot of hope is dangerous. A spark is just fine as long as its contained. (**President Snow**)*

If you want to cripple a person, threaten their children and they become submissive. I love Snow because however his life ended, it ended on his terms. Even sick and bound, he was successfully controlling the game. He knew what was coming and still bent the rules to his terms. That’s a villain that can teach us a lot about what is right and what is wrong.

# 10. Hugh d’Ambray, **[Kate Daniels](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38619.Magic_Bites?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=kBrds0TFwX&rank=1)** Series

**Ilona Andrews**\
*Steampunk dystopia/Action*

Hugh is an orphan with powerful magic that is valuable in this warped world where technology and magic fight for dominance. So when someone takes him in as a kid and gives him shelter, he’d do anything for him.

He is loyal to a fault. He is arrogant and ruthless, but when the time comes, he is protective too. I love him and hate him, I rooted for him more than the main character because he makes my heart ache for him. He has done horrible things and he’d still do them…but he is also repentant. *I wanted to help him get his freedom. He is — to date — my most favorite villain-turned-hero.*

> “I’ve done things that keep good folks up at night. Hugh d’Ambray scares me. He is the monster rough men like me fear. I’ve got blood on my hands. Hugh is up to his neck in it.” (*Rufus Fortuner* in **Iron and Magic**)

If you don’t want to read the long *Kate Daniels* series and what to get your dose of Hugh, read his standalone novel *Iron and Magic*. It’s my favorite Ilona Andres novel and I’ve read *a lot of* their work.

# Final Thoughts

*The antagonists in any story give us the drama we need as a reader, and also, they make us more attached to the main characters emotionally.* So, *good villains can make a great reading experience.* These are the ones I will remember as villains I would want to read about again and again. Sometimes, these villains are so good that I’d skip the story right to the conflict part where I get to enjoy the action and verbal contradictions in the story.
