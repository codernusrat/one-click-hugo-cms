I have a restless soul, meaning: I can’t sit still to save my life. I am always moving around and always looking for an outlet to let out my *too-big* emotions.

So you can imagine what the lockdown does to someone like me. I was about to burst after 6 months of being cooped up at home. So, when I had the chance to tag along with some relatives to the countryside, I had to say yes.

> *I’ll never forget this journey that brought me closer to the people of my country, made me appreciate the unexpected beauty of nature and the kindness of humans.*

*If I talk about this trip in one word, I’d use the word ‘eventful’. It was raining cats and dogs, we had to travel 280km, and the road was blocked due to heavy rain. This story wouldn’t come into being without this entourage of seven, a storm, a faulty car… and the generosity of strangers.*

## The Planning

I’ve always believed that the spur of the moment decisions are the best ones. One day, our relatives from the countryside called to invite me to go visit them and stay there for a few days. For me, that is the best kind of invitation. It had been years since we visited and I was absolutely up for it.

So, I gathered some of my relatives who wanted to go and made plans to leave after exactly 23 hours. We rented a micro-bus and started our hours-long journey.

We were seven in total: in which, two were elderly ladies (my aunt and grandma), and one whiny 6-year-old niece. Needless to say, this is the worst type of ragtag group for any journey that is not as smooth as possible.

My Mom was very worried. She had the misfortune of checking the weather forecast that said it’d be raining the whole week. We were going to a place that is very close to where The Meghna, one of the major rivers in the country meets the Bay of Bengal. A **level 4 warning signal** was announced in port areas. But we were already knee-deep in plans and excitement. No one could stop us from going on this adventure.

## On The Road

We started the trip smoothly. Out of the seven of us, six were females. So, I leave the amount of our luggage to your imagination. We stuffed our bags in the back and started the long trip at 5.30 in the morning. It was drizzling then, had been drizzling on and off the whole night. The roads were slick with rain and we were extra nice to the driver so that he’d be careful on the road.

Everything was okay for the first half of the journey. I slept like the dead — as I normally do — for the first two hours. Then I read a few chapters of the book I took with me…or tried to read it in between being forced to entertain my six-year-old niece who was *adamant* about sitting beside me. *I love her to pieces — but never again.*

All things went to hell as we were on the last leg of the journey. Just a 2-hour ride would be enough for us to arrive when we heard a loud sound and the front left tire of our car burst. The car swerved and screeched to a halt by the side of the road.

## Stranded in The Middle of Nowhere

We all got down from the car. It was still drizzling then, and my cousin held an umbrella over the driver’s head as he changed the tire.

> *The place was absolutely beautiful.* *On one side, there was a huge field of crops as far as we could see, and on the other side, the highway split through the heart of the green.*

*Everything was shining and bright in the rain.* We saw a weird-looking shed about 100 paces away and ran towards it for a bit of shelter in the rain. Its tin roof leaked and there were some big puddles in there, making the ground muddy and slippery. But we got to stand in bits of dry ground and we’re lucky enough to avoid getting drenched.

A couple of local men approached our rental car to ask if we needed any help. Apparently, the spare tire was also faulty and another one was in not so good shape. We needed a completely new tire. There were no garages or auto repair shops around. One of the men said that his uncle has a shop at the intersection we had just crossed. So, with no other choice, our driver decided to go fix the car, and the kind stranger stepped up to help him as he wouldn’t be able to find the shop without help.

*We were stuck in the middle of nowhere with nothing but the greenery to keep us entertained.*

## *Kindness is Still Alive*

*A couple of more people came to inquire about what happened. Everyone knew each other and gradually, it seemed like the small number of families that lived alongside this part of the highway knew about our dilemma and wanted to help in any way they could.*

*They offered us shelter. They invited us to sit in their homes as they knew it’d take some time.* We didn’t want to trouble them in these situations — really, the virus has put a dent in visiting people. Every time we called the driver, he said that he was almost done and on his way. So we foolishly waited for almost three hours.

In that dilapidated shed, there was no place to sit. So our only option was to walk along the side of the road when the rain let up a bit. But we had to worry for my grandma and aunt, as they were quite elderly, and the kid in the group, my niece. By this point, she was having a tantrum. She was hungry, tired, and irritated. We all were, but she was the only vocal one.

When the kind people couldn’t persuade us to go to their house, one of them brought chairs for us to sit in. One man brought water. They stood there the whole time, asking if we needed anything else. It was noon and they offered us lunch at their home too (though we had to decline). They stood under the shed with us when the sky got dark and rain poured. The wind wanted to rip the loose she’d from over our heads. When a piece of the rusted metal became too rogue in the storm, a couple of them brought some tools to mend it.

## After Three Hours of Stormy Weather

As the sky cleared and the rain finally let up, we saw the car approach. We couldn’t thank the strangers enough. They took us under their wing, even when we weren’t the easiest bunch to help. They helped us even when they didn’t have to. *They stayed with us to provide a type of protection that we never could have imagined.*

As we got in the car and the car started to move, I felt a strange melancholy. I was cursing the weather, the bad luck that brought this date onto us…but it was also perfect. Being stuck at home all these months, I forgot the genuineness of people, the kindness of strangers.

> *I had gotten what I set out to find: fresh air, adventure, and human interaction — all the things I had wanted but lacked in these last few months.*

We arrived at our destination at exactly 5.30 in the evening, famished and dead tired. Everyone there wanted to know what had happened. Even though they were horrified to hear about our experience, it was a great story to tell. They felt bad for us, but I wanted to smile and say it was a real eye-opener. This experience taught me to give someone a chance, trust them, *and look for the brightness even when the sky is dark. I’ll never forget this journey that brought me closer to the people of my country, made me appreciate the unexpected beauty of nature and the kindness of humans.*
